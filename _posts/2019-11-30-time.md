So yesterday I started reading [Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Time-Focus-Matters-Every/dp/0525572422)
to try and get myself out of this pattern of nothing I feel I've been in. 

In the last couple of years a lot has changed in my life but I feel like time has been passing me by at hyperspeed and I haven't really been able to accomplish all I wanted.
To be fair, There's been a lot of changes in my life but somehow I can't seem to find time for what matters to me.  

I can't really comment on the book yet since it's been a total of '1' day since I started reading it but hopefully I'll have a chance to put some of the techniques into practice soon. 

Funny enough both of them used to or might still work at Google, which is funny to me since that's my current employer.

Anyways, we'll see how it goes. Oh, does this post mean the book is already working? ðŸ¤¯
